# ðŸ“° Appcent NewsApp
#### This application is a news-sharing app developed for the Appcent internship application. The app is developed entirely programmatically. I did everything with Apple's own native library, without using any additional libraries.

The app is designed according to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The Model represents the news data, the View creates the user interface and displays the news to the user, and the ViewModel communicates between the View and the Model, processes the news data, and prepares it for display in the View.

Users can access current news through the app, view news details, be directed to the source website, and save and share news articles. The app is designed to be modular and open to development, allowing it to adapt to future changes and updates.

NOT: there were problems with the news in the API service we were asked to use, so I had to use it because it was requested to be used in the application. Unfortunately, the news coming from the API does not have an ID and there are too many of the same news, some of the news have problems with the image and title. I still tried to handle them. Thank you.
