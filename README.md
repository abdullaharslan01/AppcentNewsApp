# ðŸ“° Appcent NewsApp
#### This application is a news-sharing app developed for the Appcent internship application. The app is developed entirely programmatically using the Swift programming language, and only native libraries provided by Apple are used.

The app is designed according to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The Model represents the news data, the View creates the user interface and displays the news to the user, and the ViewModel communicates between the View and the Model, processes the news data, and prepares it for display in the View.

Users can access current news through the app, view news details, be directed to the source website, and save and share news articles. The app is designed to be modular and open to development, allowing it to adapt to future changes and updates.
